# LOCO_parse
LOCO regularization path implemented in Python, support calculating variable/feature importance as well as variable screening. 
This is in particular done for high-dimensional data, i.e. n_features > n_samples, where traditional method fails. 

For statistical inference, please go to https://github.com/statcao/LOCOpath for the R package! 

To use, 
```
git clone git@github.com:statcao/LOCO_parse.git
cd LOCO_parse
```
And then use 
```
import varImp 
```
in your own Python code.
